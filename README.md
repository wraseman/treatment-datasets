# Water Treatment Datasets
Predictive modeling in water treatment is still in its infancy and the lack of open source water treatment data is slowing its potential. This repository is a collection of treatment datasets that can be used to investigate mechanistic (i.e., physically-based) models and train machine learning/AI models. Please send me info on datasets I might be missing in the [Issues](https://github.com/wraseman/treatment-datasets/issues).

## Jar Test Data
- Source: [Paleolimbot's GitHub](https://github.com/paleolimbot/edwards97)
- Summary: Jar tests (n=500) using aluminum and ferric coagulants. Includes source waters from across the United States.
- Applications: Dunnington et al. (in-prep)

## Carbonaceous Sorbents Data
- Source: [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Deep_Learning_Neural_Network_Approach_for_Predicting_the_Sorption_of_Ionizable_and_Polar_Organic_Pollutants_to_a_Wide_Range_of_Carbonaceous_Materials/12040629)
- Summary: Carbonaceous sorbent dataset (n=329) with parameters commonly used for Fruendlich isotherms.
